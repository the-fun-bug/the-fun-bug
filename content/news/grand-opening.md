  Hi New Braunfels and surrounding families!


  It has been a long road to get here, but we are SO excited to officially announce our Grand Opening!!


  Join us at our newly renovated space on June 28th for open play, and lots of goodies! Come and see what we have been working so hard on for y'all for the past year. 


  **What you can expect-**


  Our large custom built play set is ready for your kids, along with many creative play opportunities. These include, but not even close to limited to, our custom built giant lite brite, giant legos, play kitchen and toys, doll strollers, infant push carts, and magnet tile wall.


  For the adults, we have a full coffee and specialty drink shop at the front! You can browse our menu now on our website 'cafe' tab. 


  We can't wait to welcome you all in! We know you'll love it just as much as we do. Reserve your spots now!!


  Xoxo,


  Kameron & Clay
