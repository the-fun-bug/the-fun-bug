  Hey Fun Buggers! 


  It's Kameron, your fellow New Braunfels Mama! As we near our grand opening, I want to take a moment to go over our reservation system with you all. 


  The Fun Bug Open Play will operate in 2 hour play windows. Each day of the week has slightly different hours, so please refer to our hours of operation to determine what play slot is best for you and your littles. 


  Reservations for these two hour play slots will help us manage capacity to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone. Our space is subject to fire code regulations, which limit the number of guests we can accommodate at one time. By reserving your spot via our website, you can guarantee entry and avoid potential disappointment if we reach capacity. While we welcome walk-ins, availability is not guaranteed, so a reservation is the best way to secure your visit.


  We understand that with little ones you may not always be able to plan ahead. If you haven't reserved a spot ahead of time, you can check our reservation portal via our website to see if and how many spots are left for your preferred time. If we have spots open, you are more than welcome to come on in! However, in order to accomodate the play session following yours, if you and your littles arrive after the start time of the current session you will only be able to play until the end of it (and not the full two hours). 


  **How do I reserve my play session spot(s)?**


  To reserve your spot, simply visit our website and click on 'Reserve Play Time' on our home page. This will take you to our reservation portal where you can choose your preferred date and time, as well as complete your payment. You may arrive 10 minutes prior to the start of your play session. When you arrive at our studio, please check in at the front desk and complete any necessary waivers. A staff member will announce 10 minutes prior to the end of your play session to begin gathering your kids and belongings so that we can get ready for the next group. 


  \*Each child needs a play spot reserved for them.


  You are of course, more than welcome to purchase spots for multiple play sessions if your kids would like more than 2 hours to play. 


  **How do I reserve my play session spot(s) if I have an active membership?**


  Easy! Each member will have their own unique booking code (emailed to them at the time of purchasing membership) for play reservations. Simply follow the same steps above, and enter your code at checkout to reserve your spot. 


  If you have any questions at all please reach out to me directly, I am happy to help. As always, I can't wait to meet all of you!


  Xoxo,


  Kameron
