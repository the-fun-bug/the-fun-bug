  Exciting news for parents and kids alike in New Braunfels! The Fun Bug Play
  Studio & Parties, a brand-new children's indoor play space, is set to
  officially open its doors on November 15, 2024. Owners Kameron and Clay Saur,
  parents of two young children, Olivia ("Bug") and Levi ("Worm"), were inspired
  to create a clean, safe, and fun space for families. Recognizing the need for
  more indoor play options in the area, the Saur family is thrilled to offer a
  unique, creative environment where children can explore and parents can relax.




  The Fun Bug will feature a custom-built wooden play structure, soft play mats, and endless opportunities for creative and active play. Designed with both kids and parents in mind, the space offers not only fun but also convenience. Adults can enjoy delicious drinks, lounge in comfortable seating, and take advantage of free Wi-Fi while their little ones play safely. Kameron describes the space as "fun, clean, and aesthetic," ensuring itâ€™s a welcoming spot for all who visit.




  In addition to its open play hours, The Fun Bug will also double as a party rental venue after hours, offering private access to the entire facility. Whether you're hosting a birthday party or another special event, The Fun Bug provides a perfect, kid-friendly space that guarantees fun for everyone. Kameron and Clay are eager to meet the local community and can't wait to welcome families to experience The Fun Bug starting this November!
